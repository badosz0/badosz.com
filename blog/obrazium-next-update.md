Obrazium launched on February 06, 2021 and it has been growing since then.
It successfully recived over 10.000 requests in last month itself (that's 300+ every dayðŸŽ‰).
Obviously it's still not perfect and there are important things missing like a good documentation or terms of service.

### New Design

I really liked the current design, but I felt like it could be a little more "professional". After a bunch of iterations I came up with something I like a lot more. Therefore in the next update Obrazium should look like something like this:

### Sharing

With the upcoming update there also will be new functionality: "Sharing". I'm aware of the fact that there are people, which are working in teams, but can't share their dashboard without sharing their github account. This will change in the upcoming update and you will be able to share your dashboard with up to 3 people. You will be also able to decide if people, you are sharing dashboard with, can see your token.

### Showcase

I'm also thinking about adding a page where everyone can add their discord bots (that are using Obrazium obviously). However, I am not sure how it would work yet and if I want to do it at all.

### Release Date

I'm planning to release this update mid April, but knowing me, I'm not promising anything ðŸ˜….
